# iNeo
--Integrated pipeline for neo-antigen prediction.

#introduction

iNeo is an integrated pipeline for prediting neo-antigens which are generated by tumor somatic mutations. It utilizes various bioinformatics softwares and scripts to identify tumor neo-antigens in whole-exome/genome sequencing data.

#how to use

	1. run install.sh
	2. download required databases 
	3. download hg19 reference fasta file and make index    download url: http://genome.ucsc.edu/
	4. open Neoantigen.workflow.v1.1.pl in scripts/ directory with vi and set the working directory then save by inputting: :wq
	5. run Neoantigen.workflow.v1.1.pl and command line will show help message

#demo case
	The demo/ directory shows a small-sample demonstration of Neoantigen.v1.1 but cannot run properly due to lack of required databases.
